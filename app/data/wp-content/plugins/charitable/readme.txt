= Why we made Charitable =

We built Charitable because we were tired of seeing non-profits use hosted fundraising platforms that charge hefty fees and strip them of the ability to brand & control their donation pages. Other WordPress donation plugins existed, but they missed important functionality or were poorly supported, leaving non-profits to choose between expensive platforms or plugins lacking the features they really needed.

So we created & launched Charitable in 2015 as a feature-rich, affordable WordPress alternative to hosted fundraising platforms. With Charitable, we won’t charge you any transaction fees for the donations you receive, and you can use the core Charitable plugin for free, forever. We support Charitable’s development through extension purchases, which add extra features.

Four years on, we still actively develop and support Charitable, which is trusted by over 10,000 non-profits all over the world.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I accept donations directly on my site? =

Yes you can! If you use PayPal, donors will be redirected to PayPal to complete their donation. However, you can use the Offline Donations gateway to allow your donors to create a donation and make the payment via cheque or bank transfer (you can display your payment details to them).

Better yet, let your donors make credit card donations directly on your WordPress website with the following payment gateway extensions:

* [Stripe](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-stripe?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_content=avoid-paypal&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)
* [Braintree](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-braintree?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_content=avoid-paypal&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)
* [Authorize.Net](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-authorize-net?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_content=avoid-paypal&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)

This works with PayPal, Stripe, Braintree, Authorize.Net and PayFast.

Indeed you can! Charitable is the best way to run peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns with WordPress. Peer-to-peer fundraisers are supported with our [Ambassadors extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-ambassadors/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)

= Can I let donors pay the gateway processing fees? =

= Can I add donors to my newsletter or email marketing list? =

You certainly can. The [Newsletter Connect extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-newsletter-connect/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals) supports MailChimp, Campaign Monitor, ActiveCampaign, Mailerlite, MailPoet and Mailster.

= Can I translate Charitable into my language? =

You can. Charitable has full localization support through the `charitable` textdomain. All Charitable extensions are also fully translatable.

== Changelog ==

= 1.6.54 =
* NEW: Added methods for retrieving the subtotal (excluding Fee Relief fees) and total (including fees) donated for a donation, with `$donation->get( 'subtotal' )` and `$donation->get( 'total' )` respectively. This is used by the new Automation Connect integration.
* FIX: When creating a manual donation, the list of campaigns is now in alphabetical order to make it easier to find the campaign you're looking for. [#894](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/894)
* FIX: Resolved an error when using the Campaign Categories / Terms widget.

= 1.6.53 =
* FIX: Resolves a number of issues that caused warnings or notices when using Charitable with PHP 8 or MySQL 8.
* FIX: When calling `$campaign->get( 'allow_custom_donations' )`, the return value will now always be an integer.
* FIX: A bug in the data processor class was preventing campaign terms from being saved correctly when submitting campaigns with Charitable Ambassadors.

= 1.6.52 =
* FIX: When adding manual donations, the donation date was incorrectly set to December 31, 1999.
* FIX: Use `wp_kses_post` when returning `false` to the `charitable_sanitize_suggested_amount_description` filtered adding in Charitable 1.6.51. This will allow HTML to be used in suggested donation descriptions, while still stripping out any dangerous code, such as Javascript. By default, `charitable_sanitize_suggested_amount_description` returns `true` and will be filtered to exclude all HTML.

= 1.6.51 =
* SECURITY FIX: Fixes a critical cross-site scripting vulnerability. See [our blog](https://www.wpcharitable.com/blog/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=changelog-tab&utm_campaign=release-notes&utm_content=1-6-51-release) for a post in the coming days.
* SECURITY FIX: Removes the `unfiltered_html` capability from Campaign Managers.
* FIX: Allow campaign category/tag taxonomies to be translated in the Campaign Categories / Tags widget.

= 1.6.50 =

= 1.6.49 =
* FIX: Fixed problem where the page scrolls to the wrong spot when a donation form is submitted with errors. [#882](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/882)

* FIX: Proper handling of minimum donation amounts where commas are used as the decimal separator and the minimum donation amount has cents (i.e. two euros and fifty cents). Please note that the minimum donation amount should be set with a period used as the decimal separator. [#888](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/888)
* FIX: Proper handling of donation amount added via the Campaign Donation widget, where commas are used as the decimal separator. [#887](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/887)

= 1.6.48 =
* FIX: Better compatibility with TranslatePress to allow certain strings that were otherwise not translateable to be translated.
* FIX: Removed a PHP notice that would appear on 404 pages. [#864](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/864)

= 1.6.47 =
* SECURITY FIX: Prevent email verification emails from being triggered without the input of the registered user. [#863](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/863)
* FIX: Updated Weglot support to handle updates in Weglot 3.3.0. [#861](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/861)

* FIX: Prevent endless redirect when using Weglot and displaying donation forms on the same page as the campaign.
* FIX: Improve compatibility with WP Super Cache.

= 1.6.45 =

* FIX: Check hidden fields when checking if a donation is a recurring donation. [#819](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/819)

* FIX: Prevent a fatal error encountered when using the Twenty Twenty theme and Oxygen Builder. [#829](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/829)

= 1.6.44 =
* NEW: When using WPML, the total funds raised by a campaign will now include both the campaign itself and any translations of the same campaign. [#811](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/811)
* FIX: Ensure that the selected recurring donation amount is picked up when you reach a donation form via the Donate widget. [#804](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/804)
* FIX: Improved display of checkboxes in TwentyTwenty theme. [#812](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/812)
* FIX: When using WPML, clicking Donate button on the non-primary language version of a campaign results leads back to the primary language version of the campaign, instead of the donation form. [#810](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/810)

* FIX: Split some parts of the charitable.js file into small, single-purpose Javascript files to be loaded when needed. [#815](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/815)
* FIX: Avoided clash of `charitable_user_address_fields` filter name. This was used in three separate places in different ways. The one most commonly used was in the context of loading fields to show in the Profile Form, and this is where the filter is still used unchanged. In `Charitable_User::get_address()`, the filter name has changed to `charitable_user_address_details`. [#816](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/816)
* DEPRECATED: `Charitable_User::get_address_fields()` function is deprecated and will be removed. It was previously unused anywhere by Charitable or its extensions. [#816](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/816)

= 1.6.43 =
* NEW: When using Polylang, the total funds raised by a campaign will now include both the campaign itself and any translations of the same campaign. [#798](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/798)

* FIX: Changed the campaign status tags, allowing them to be translated. [#797](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/797)
* FIX: When using TranslatePress, Charitable will record the locale used by the donor when making their donation and will use that locale when sending them donation-specific emails, like their donation receipt. [#795](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/795)

= 1.6.42 =

* FIX: Prevent Charitable from opening the donation form in a new window. [#789](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/789)
* FIX: Provide the ability to prevent scrolling to the top of the donation form when there is an error, to allow for situations where inline error messaging can provide more clarity. [#791](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/791)

= 1.6.41 =
* NEW: Add the site currency, country code and test mode setting to the Javascript variables to allow scripts to take that into account. This was specifically required by the new Braintree extension (coming soon!). [#784](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/784)
* FIX: Improved styling for the campaign meta boxes and admin donation form fields.
* FIX: In some cases, specifically with the Ambassadors front-end campaign form, campaign categories and tags were removed when updating a campaign due to an issue with the way `Charitable_Campaign_Processor` class. [#785](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/785)
* FIX: Prevent WordPress from treating any Charitable endpoints as a 404 page. This is a general fix but specifically resolves an issue encountered with Polylang when trying to verify your email address or change your password. [#776](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/776)
* FIX: Block redirects caused by the Permalink Manager plugin when the "canonical redirect" setting is enabled. [#765](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/765)
* FIX: Ensure that Polylang translations for donation form fields and campaign fields are picked up correctly when the language is determined from the content. [#776](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/776)

= 1.6.40 =
* FIX: Use the correct positioning of the currency symbol when formatting amounts with the symbol via Javascript (only affects Fee Relief). [#777](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/777)
* FIX: Get the month names for the current locale when showing a datepicker field in the front-end. Currently this only affects the front-end campaign in Charitable Ambassadors. [#781](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/781)

= 1.6.39 =
* SECURIY FIX: Prevent disclosure of campaign and donation information in the WordPress dashboard to users who should not have access to it. [#775](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/775)

* NEW: Added additional currencies supported by our new [Windcave payment gateway integration](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-windcave/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=changelog-tab&utm_campaign=windcave). [#760](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/760)
* FIX: If you are using a zero-decimal currency such as the Japanese Yen, the decimal count setting will now automatically be set to 0. [#761](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/761)
* FIX: When using Recurring Donations, the donation amount in the donor's session would not be used correctly in the donation form if the Variable recurring donation method is used. [#762](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/762)

* FIX: Proper HTML value for the 'required' attribute.

= 1.6.33 =
* FIX: The fix to the Firefox form submission issue in 1.6.32 caused unexpected issues in other browsers, including Chrome. [#743](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/743)

* FIX: A bug was preventing the `charitable_default_donation_amount` filter from correctly setting the default donation amount. [#737](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/737)
* FIX: In Firefox, the way Charitable saved the clicked form button's name and value are not correctly passed through as a hidden field. [#740](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/740)

= 1.6.31 =
* FIX: Respect the `hide_if_no_donors` argument in the Donors shortcode. [#734](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/734)

= 1.6.27 =
* NEW: Added `charitable_disable_cookie` filter to provide the ability to completely disable the `charitable_session` cookie. The `charitable_session` cookie is a necessary cookie used to keep track of your donation history whilst your session is active. This allows you to access your donation receipt without being a registered, logged-in user. It is also used when you submit the Campaign Donation widget form to track the amount you would like to donate to the campaign, as well as the donation period (one-time, monthly, etc.). [#717](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/717)

* FIX: Improved how fields registered through the Fields APIs are sorted, allowing you to modify the position of a field by setting its `show_before` or `show_after` value. [#707](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/707)

= 1.6.26 =
* FIX: Resolves a bug with Recurring Donations that resulted in a pre-set custom recurring donation amount not being registered as the active choice properly. [#713](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/713)
* FIX: When using Ultimate Member, if your Profile page in Charitable was set to UM's User page, it messed up Charitable's Endpoints API. [#710](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/710)
* FIX: Also with Ultimate Member, fixed issue where Charitable's user email verification process fails while UM is active. [#711](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/711)
* FIX: Fatal error on PHP 5.2. [#712](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/712)

= 1.6.25 =
* NEW: Automatically set the selected amount in the donation form by appending query parameters to the donation form URL. For example, going to `https://yoursite.com/campaigns/my-campaign/?amount=10` will load the donation form with a $10 donation preset. [#684](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/684)
* NEW: Mark a user's email address as verified when they complete Ultimate Member's email activation process. [#709](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/709)

* FIX: Add `singular.php` as a fallback template to use for Charitable endpoints.
* FIX: Ensure that `wp_title` has a page name set for Charitable endpoints. [#660](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/660)

* FIX: Fixed error that prevented Charitable settings using a select element from correctly showing the current selected value if the value is 0. [#639](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/639)
* UPDATE: Replaced `ambassadors_form` with `campaign_form` in the Campaign Fields API. `ambassadors_form` has thus far been unused; `campaign_form` will be supported in the next release of Charitable Ambassadors.

= 1.6.24 =
* UPDATE: Officially adopted Unicode CLDR recommendations for country names. Several country names have been updated. [#704](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/704) and [#700](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/700)
* FIX: Show which fields are required in the admin donation form. [#702](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/702)

* FIX: In some cases, the js.cookie script was not loaded correctly due to the presence of Javascript module loaders, which resulted in Charitable's session script not working correctly. [#699](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/699)

= 1.6.22 =

* NEW: Include Charitable version in Javascript vars. This is available as `CHARITABLE_VARS.version`. We also added a way to check that Charitable is at least a certain version, using `CHARITABLE.VersionCompare( version )` (where `version` is the version it must be).
* NEW: Added extra jQuery events when processing/viewing a donation form: `charitable:form:processed`, triggered right after a donation is created but before being redirected to the donation receipt or payment page; `charitable:form:amount:changed`, triggered when the donor changes the amount they are donating; `charitable:form:total:changed`, triggered when the donor changes the total amount they are donating (i.e. they choose a different payment amount or opt in to pay the processing fees).
* NEW: Added `charitable_my_donation_total_amount` filter to allow the donation amount shown in the output of `[charitable_my_donations]` to include any processing fees paid by the donor.
* FIX: Improved return links for settings pages nested under other settings page (i.e. individual MailChimp list settings page links back to MailChimp settings).
* FIX: `charitable_get_current_url()` returned incorrect URLs on multisite. [#687](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/687)

* NEW: Added Webhook Listener endpoint to provide pretty URL for IPNs/webhooks. <strong>Note: The IPN listener is now run on the `parse_query` hook, which is later than previously when it was run on the `init` hook.</strong> [#659](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/659)
* NEW: Added option to force HTTPS for the IPN/Webhook listener URL. This is off by default but can be enabled by returning `true` to the `charitable_webhook_listener_endpoint_force_https` filter.

* NEW: Added the username in the output of [charitable_profile]. [#325](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/325)

* NEW: Added `unsigned` to columns in both the `charitable_campaign_donations` and `charitable_donors` tables.

= 1.4.18 =
* Added an end time when editing campaigns to make it clearer when a campaign ends. Previously, a campaign's end time was ambiguous and this caused confusion for some users. [#335](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/335)
* Add space as a thousands separator for countries where `12 500,00` would be the correct way to format an amount. [#332](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/332)

* Persist un-rendered notices across page loads. [#314](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/314)
* Hide radio inputs when Javascript is enabled. [#312](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/312)
* We made some minor improvements to how the donation form submission is processed in Javascript. Needed for improvements to Stripe extension.

= 1.4.12 =
* If you were using our [Easy Digital Downloads Connect extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-easy-digital-downloads-connect/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=changelog-tab&utm_campaign=edd-connect) and your site language is not English, you may have had problems with end dates for your benefactor relationships not saving correctly. We've fixed up that bug now. [#305](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/305)

= 1.4.11 =
* Corrected a problem that caused newly created/saved campaigns without an end date to stop showing in the `[campaigns]` shortcode output. [#301](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/301)

= 1.4.9 =

= 1.4.8 =
* Removed some code left over from plugin testing.

= 1.4.7 =
* Avoid issues with PayPal IPNs missing the 'invoice' parameter in certain cases — likely a bug on the PayPal end. This resulted in donations remaining stuck as Pending. We have reworked how IPNs are processed to avoid reliance on this and avoid further issues. [#289](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/289)
* Store the PayPal transaction ID for donations after an IPN has been received. [#270](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/270)

* Fix client-side credit card validation. [#280](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/280)

* Ensure that the donation form script is always loaded for the campaign donation widget. [#239](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/239)
* Fixes a bug that prevented the password reset from working correctly. [#238](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/238)
* Refer to campaigns as campaigns instead of posts in admin update messages. [#234](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/234)

= 1.4.5 =
* The permissions for accessing Donations and Campaigns in the WordPress dashboard has changed. Users who are set up as Campaign Managers can access both Donations and Campaigns, but cannot access Charitable settings. This permission is reserved for admin users. In addition, the `manage_charitable_settings` permission has been removed from Campaign Managers. [#209](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/209)
* Fixes the way donations are processed in Javascript to avoid issues when the donation is *not* processed with AJAX (currently, this is only the case if you're using the Easy Digital Downloads extension, Pronamic iDEAL or an old version of one of our premium payment gateway extensions). [#223](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/223)
* Fixes the registration form shortcode, which was being printed out too early on the page. [#224](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/224)
* Adds a new filter for the list of active payment gateways: `charitable_active_gateways`. See `Charitable_Gateways::get_active_gateways()`.
* Three new methods have been added to the `Charitable_Donation` abstract class: `get_donation_type()` retrieves the type of donation; `get_donation_plan_id()` returns the ID of the recurring donation plan (to be used by the Recurring Donations extension); `get_donation_plan()` returns the recurring donation object. [PR #215](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/pull/215)
* Export files now include the type of export (note: this does not work if you are on PHP 5.2). [#200](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/200)
* The `custom` parameter for PayPal donations now accepts a JSON string. [PR #198](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/pull/198)

= 1.4.4 =
* Resolves a new issue related to the donation form validation introduced in version 1.4.3, which prevented the donation widget form from being submitted. [#221](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/204) and [#205](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/221)
* Fixes a bug that resulted in logged in users who had never made a donation being able to see a list of all donations with the `[charitable_my_donations]` shortcode. No personal donor data was displayed, and the donation receipts remained inaccessible to the users. All they could see was the date of the donation, the campaign donated to and the amount of the donation. [#220](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/204) and [#205](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/220)

= 1.4.3 =
* Added a new sandbox testing tool to allow you to test your PayPal donation flow. If you're using PayPal, you should test this as soon as you can to avoid disruption, as PayPal is making some security upgrades to its platform which may cause problems for certain sites. [Read more about how PayPal's upgrades will affect you](https://www.wpcharitable.com/how-paypals-ssl-certificate-upgrade-will-affect-you-and-how-you-can-prepare-for-it/?utm_source=notice&utm_medium=wordpress-dashboard&utm_campaign=paypal-ssl-upgrade&utm_content=blog-post)
* Added honeypot form validation for the donation form and registration, password reset, forgot password and profile forms. This is an anti-spam measure designed to prevent fake donations from being created by bots.
* Prevent donations from being created if an invalid email address or payment gateway is used.
* Ensure that client-side validation is always performed for donations, even when the gateway integration has not been updated for compatibility with the AJAX-driven donations introduced in version 1.3. The only gateway that we know of that falls into this category is Pronamic iDEAL, so this is a nice update if you are using Pronamic iDEAL.

= 1.4.2 =
* Added a link to the registration form from the login form and vice versa. [#204](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/204) and [#205](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/205)
* Included two new parameters in the `[charitable_registration]` shortcode: `redirect` sets the default page that people should be redirect to after registering, and `login_link_text` sets the text of the login link (see above). [#208](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/208) and [#205](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/205)
* Also included a new parameter in the `[charitable_login]` shortcode: `registration_link_text` sets the text of the login link (see above). [#204](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/204)
* Added a column for the campaign creator to the campaigns page in the WordPress dashboard. [#166](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/166)
* Added three new fields that can be displayed in donation-related emails, like the donation receipt or admin notification: the total amount donated, the campaign(s) that received the donation and the categories of the campaign(s) that received the donation. [#202](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/202) and [#203](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/203)
* Made sure that setting the `order` parameter in the `[campaigns]` shortcode works with lowercase and uppercase. `ASC`, `DESC`, `asc` and `desc` are all valid options now. [#206](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/206)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the campaign end date from saving when using Charitable in a non-English installation. [#201](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/201)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the comments section from appearing on campaigns when modal donations were enabled. [#210](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/210)
* Fixed a bug that caused a PHP warning when trying to use the `site_url` email shortcode parameter in emails.

= 1.4.1 =
* The donor address is split over multiple columns in the donation export. [#194](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/194)
* In certain cases, credit card validation was getting triggered for non-credit card donations (i.e. PayPal or Offline). This bug has been fixed. [#189](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/189)
* After a donor makes a successful donation is made, their session is cleared as expected. [#181](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/181)
* Pending and draft campaigns are now included in the filtering options on the Donations page. [#187](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/187)
* The Bolivian Boliviano currency (BOB) has been added. [#193](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/193)

= 1.4.0 =
* Added the `[charitable_my_donations]` shortcode. Use this shortcode to allow logged in users to view a history of their donations, including links to the donation receipts. [#14](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/14)
* Scale the campaign grid gracefully when viewing on smaller screens. The `[campaigns]` shortcode now supports a `responsive` paramater, which is enabled by default. You can set it to a specific px/em amount to change the breakpoint, or set it to `0` to disable responsive styling. [#88](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/88)
* Also provided appropriately responsive styling for suggested donation amounts on small screens. [#159](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/159)
* Added client-side validation for the donation form. This checks whether donors have filled out all the required fields, whether they're donating more than $0 (because seriously, a $0 donation won't go far :)) and whether they have used a valid credit card (if you're using our Stripe or Authorize.Net extensions). [#176](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/176) and [#63](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/63)
* Added a password reset process to provide a complete user-facing login and registration workflow. [#89](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/89)
* Include an `order` paramater for the `[campaigns]` shortcode, to reverse the direction in which campaigns are displayed. [#64](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/64)
* Allow campaigns in the `[campaigns]` shortcode to be ordered by any of the orderby options for [`WP_Query`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters).
* Added drag and drop support for the Picture form field, which is used in the User Avatar and Ambassadors extensions. [#111](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/111)
* Improved how the plugin checks for updates to Charitable extensions, to keep the WordPress dashboard running smoothly. [#133](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/133)
* Added a `charitable_create_donation()` function for developers who want to create donations programatically. [#109](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/109)
* Added a new `Charitable_Donations_Query` class, which can be used by developers to retrieve donations from the database. [#155](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/155)
* Added a new `Charitable_Deprecated` class, which is used to record any incorrect usage of Charitable functions or methods.
* Switched to using the built-in edit.php admin page for listing Charitable donations, instead of relying on a custom admin page with a custom posts table. While there, we also simplified the interface and added colour-coding to the donation statuses. [#110](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/110)
* Include the donor's phone number, address and the payment method in the donations export CSV. [#154](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/154)
* When multiple gateways are enabled, the default one is listed first in the donation form. [#139](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/139)
* Automatically cancel a donation when the donor returns from the gateway before completing it. This works with PayPal, PayUMoney and PayFast. [#90](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/90) and [#117](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/117)
* Added a `Charitable_Donor::__toString()` method, so that echoing the object simply prints out the donor name.
* Added `charitable_sanitize_amount()` function to convert any amount of type string into a float.
* Trim the currency symbol from monetary amounts to prevent the symbol being treated as part of the amount. [#145](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/pull/145)
* Trim the currency symbol from the suggested donation amounts when saving a campaign. [#147](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/147)
* When a donation fails and the user is redirected back to the donation form, they can re-attempt the same donation. Previously, a new donation would have been created, leaving a phantom pending donation behind. [#106](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/106)
* Prevent duplicate donations caused by clicking the donate button repeatedly. [#164](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/164)
* Fixed a bug related to empty content in the Layers theme. [#9](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/9)

= 1.3.7 =
* Makes `Charitable_Currency::get_currency_symbol()` a publicly accessible method.
* Allow email shortcode values to be dynamically generated without being registered first. This simplifies the process of displaying dynamic data within emails if there is no existing shortcode output for it. [#134](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/134)
* Provide a consistent api for determining the status of a campaign. Developers can use `$campaign->get_status_key()` (where `$campaign` is a `Charitable_Campaign` object) to check whether a campaign is inactive, ended, ended and successfully funded, ended and not successfully funded, ending soon, or active.
* Reset the positioning and styling of the modal when window or modal change in size. This prevents the modal from growing larger than the size of the window without having scrollbars. [#135](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/135)

= 1.3.6 =
* Prevented campaigns being created with no suggested donation amounts and custom donations disabled. This results in $0 donations. [#127](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/127)
* Fixed errors when exporting donations with errors set to display. [#128](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/128)
* Deprecated `Charitable_Email::return_value_if_has_valid_donation()` method, since this was completely broken and should not be used.

= 1.3.5 =
* Added `is_preview()` method to `Charitable_Email` class.
* Added `get_donations()` method to `Charitable_Donor` class.
* Improved custom post status labels.
* Only include completed payments in the Donation Statistics dashboard widget, for the period summaries.
* Fixed PHP notices in email previews.
* Deprecated `Charitable_Session::get_session_id()`. We are no longer using a public session ID.

= 1.3.4 =
* Added selective refresh support for Charitable widgets.
* Added support for passing multiple campaign IDs to campaign donation queries. [#112](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/112)
* Fixed a bug where donors without a completed donation were included in the donor count in the Donation Stats widget. [#114](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/114)
* Fixed a bug that incorrectly set the from address for emails to always be the site email address, instead of using the provided settings. [#113](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/113)
* Fixed a bug that stopped the cron scheduler from being activated in any new installs.
* Fixed display issues in the Charitable settings area with number fields.
* Deprecated usage of `shortcode_atts()` for the email shortcode, in favor of `wp_parse_args()`. If you relied on the `shortcode_atts_charitable_email` filter, this will no longer do anything and you should test & update your code.

= 1.3.3 =
* Fixes a bug that prevented donors being able to access their donation receipts after making their donation.
* Flush rewrite rules after installation to avoid "Page not found" errors.

= 1.3.2 =
* Fixed a bug that turned comments off everywhere. [#104](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/104)
* Added a better fallback for donations for users with Javascript enabled, when using the modal donation forms. [#60](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/60)
* Avoid sending donation notifications & receipts multiple times when a donation's status is toggled on/off Paid. [#96](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/96)
* Donate button in campaign grids links to the campaign page when the donation form is set up to show on the same page as the campaign. [#107](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/107)
* Fixed a bug that caused invalid shortcode options to show for custom emails sub-classing `Charitable_Email`. [#95](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/95)

= 1.3.1 =
* **APOLOGIES**: 1.3.0 introduced a couple of bugs that we failed to pick up on before releasing the update. We have fixed those bugs now and are working on improving the process around how we push out updates, to avoid issues like this in the future.
* Removes leftover testing code that prevented campaigns from being created or edited.
* Format the donation amount so that PayPal can understand it (PayPal doesn't like amounts with more than two decimal places). [See issue](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/102)
* Prevent PHP notice when making a donation. [See issue](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/100)
* Fixes a bug that prevented the Donate widget from working as expected.

If you were calling any of these directly or using the `charitable_templates_start` hook, update your application code. All templates are now loaded via a single method: `Charitable_Templates::template_loader()`. All custom body classes are added via `charitable_add_body_classes()`. `Charitable_Templates::remove_admin_bar_from_widget_template()` has been replaced with `charitable_hide_admin_bar()`.

[See the documentation](https://www.wpcharitable.com/documentation/the-campaigns-shortcode/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=changelog-tab&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals&utm_content=1-2-3-release) for details on how to use the new argument.
